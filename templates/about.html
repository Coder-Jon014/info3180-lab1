                    I am Jon-Daniel Coombs, an enthusiastic and passionate 20-year old aspiring to become a UI/UX Designer and currently pursuing a B.Sc.Degree in Computer Science at the University of the West Indies. From a young age, I have always been obsessed with the design of technology and so throughout the years, I have come to realize that nothing beats designing a product that not only solves a persistent problem but is also aesthetically pleasing to the eyes of others and welcomes them to use it and with the advancement of the society this need becomes even more prevalent. This has inspired me to make use of my solution-oriented personality along with the combination of technology and design, to create dynamic and satisying websites and apps, that will enhance user experience while providing a solution to your problem. </p>
